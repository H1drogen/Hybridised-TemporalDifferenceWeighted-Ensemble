# DQN with Model-Based Exploration

This project implements Deep Q-Networks (DQN) enhanced with model-based exploration. The algorithm combines model-free and model-based reinforcement learning to improve exploration and learning efficiency, especially in environments with sparse rewards.

## Features

- Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent
- Model-based exploration strategy
- Suitable for environments with sparse rewards

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   
To train the agent, run:
   ```bash
   python train.py --env <environment-name> --episodes <number-of-episodes>
   ```
